Dieting process:
1. remove all FODMAP groups for 2-6 weeks. Can eat..
  - more meats, fish, eggs,
  - Certain dairy products/cheeses: Bree, cheddar, Feta. the Fermentation processs digests and pre-processes the lactose.
  - Almond milk.
  - Certain grains: rice, quinoa, oats.
  - Certain vergetables: eggplants, potatoes, tomatotes, zuchinni, cucumber.
  - Certain fruits: strawberries, grapes, pineapple, blueberreies, oranges.   
7. Re-introduce one group at a time; there are 5 groups as shown in the table above.
  - well tolerated FODMAPs: continue to eat.
  - not well tolerated FODMAPs: restrict to a tolerable level. Aim is not to eliminate. Moderate is usually ok.

Other questions:
- Should we eat less when stressed (i.e., during generic stress, when travelling, or when short on sleep)?
  - I've noticed during sleepless night the following i day i am more gassy, gas is smellier, more bloated, etc.

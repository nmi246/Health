Our Blue Light Blocking Glasses are our nighttime glasses with a red/amber lens. Peer reviewed academic studies have shown that the best Blue Light Blocking Glasses need to block 100% of blue and green light between 400-550nm.
Our Blue Light Blocking Glasses have been lab spectrometer tested to block 100% of blue and green light between 400-550nm making them one of the most optimal Blue Light Blocking Glasses available.
Our Blue Light Blocking Glasses are made in an optics laboratory and not factories, meaning experienced optical technicians create each lens. This also allows us to offer prescription, readers and non-prescription glasses and deliver a three-stage quality control process before shipping your glasses off to you.
We offer full transparency on our lens capabilities, making our lens reports available to everyone on our website before purchase, allowing you to see exactly what frequencies of light are blocked. These can be found under each pair of glasses on our website.
Our Blue Light Blocking Glasses are classified as medical devices in Australia and are included in the ARTG under 388832, 388832 and 388834. Our Blue Light Blocking Glasses also hold FDA registration.

When buying glasses:
1.	Ensure they are made in an optics lab.
2.	Ensure the lens test report is available.
3.	Ensure the lens test report shows 100% blue and green light blocked from 400-450nm.
4.	Ensure the Blue Light Blocking Glasses are registered with the FDA and TGA.
5.	Ensure the lenses are amber/red otherwise they will not be blocking enough blue and green light to improve your sleep.

By wearing our Blue Light Blocking Glasses 2-3 hours before your bedtime, you block the light that scientific studies have shown to disrupt your melatonin production. This creates a kind of psychological darkness which tells your circadian clock that it’s nighttime and to produce more melatonin.

How Do I Pick The Best Frame Fit?
Firstly, we recommend identifying which frames will best suit your face shape. You can do this on each collection page by applying the “Face Shape” filter.
Secondly, check the frame measurements by using our size guide.
If your BON CHARGE glasses arrive and do not fit perfectly, your local optometrist can easily adjust them to fit. They do this either for free or for a nominal fee. However, you can exchange as many times as you like with BON CHARGE until you get the perfect fit.

What About Peripheral Light Leakage, Is This An Issue?
We do not deem peripheral light too much of an issue.
The iPRGC receptors are in the inner retina and function in such a way that the extremely minor light that may peek through sides or top of frames is not enough for the PLR (pupillary light reflex) to phototransduct to any large degree because the iris is open to a wider diameter due to the lens themselves already putting a dynamic reduction in light volume. In simpler terms, light can only affect our circadian rhythm if it shines directly into our eyes. Light coming from the sides doesn't penetrate into the back of the eye.
However, if you suffer from light sensitivity and deem peripheral light an issue, we recommend our fully wrap around frame called Onyx.

-	Place light low: on the wall or ground. Avoid ceiling lights. 	
-	Candle or moon light are also good options.

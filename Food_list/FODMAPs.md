### How to do FODMAP diets - The 3 steps: 
1. Elimination – In the elimination phase of the FODMAP diet, you eliminate all FODMAP carbs for several weeks. Your symptoms may improve immediately or over several weeks.
2. Reintroduction – In the reintroduction phase of the FODMAP diet, you’ll introduce FODMAPs one at a time to identify which foods you can tolerate and in what amount.
3.. Personalization – Finally, you’ll modify your diet to increase variety while adjusting the type and amount of FODMAP carbs you eat, based on what you learned in step 2.

## Other questions:
- Should we eat less when stressed (i.e., during generic stress, when travelling, or when short on sleep)?
  - I've noticed during sleepless night the following i day i am more gassy, gas is smellier, more bloated, etc.

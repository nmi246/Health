# Protein Supplements (Powder and Liquid)

Recommendations by Peter Attia (15/03/2024):  
**Criteria:**
- taste: Not too sweet, if it is sweet must not be too sweet with chemically like flavour
- Must be high quality: without proprietary blends, nitrogen spiking, etc.
  - see Podcast Ep with Peter and Layne Norton on protein powerders.
- Peter generally looks for Whey Protein Isolate, doesn't mind Casein also (is slower release).   

## Protein Powders

### Muscle Egg - Vanilla flavoured protein drink
- https://www.muscleegg.com/shop/liquid-egg-whites/vanilla/2-gallons-vanilla/
- Is an Egg based protien. Liquid and Powered forms available. Peter had liquid form.
- Pros: In terms of digestibility Egg protein may higher in absorption than Whey protein. Beef Protein is also slightly ahead of Milk protein in absorption. Both likley only have a minor edge.
- Warning - may cause Biotin deficiency? See Chris Masterjohn video on 'High protein diets and Biotin'. Generally Biotin requirements are higher on high protein diets.
